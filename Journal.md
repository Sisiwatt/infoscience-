1.What did we do?
2.What did you learn?
3.What question do I have

1.We watched a video about algorithmic thinking. Then, Mr.Ruben make us a sandwich by writing down a very specific explanation.
2.We learned about algorithmic thinking, what is it and why is it important. Also, learned more about the program.
3.Not really a question, but if it's possible, could you go a liitle bit slower when it comes to the program part? I've never learned it before
